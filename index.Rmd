# Purpose

This document summarizes the results of a survey of Psychology Department graduate students conducted in 2017. It concerns the quantitative methods courses they have taken, and wish to have offered in the future.

# Plan

1. Import the data
2. Clean it, as necessary
2. Visualize the data

# Import and clean

```{r}
quant_surv_df <- readr::read_csv("csv/quant_course_survey-2017-clean.csv")
str(quant_surv_df)
```

# Visualize

## Top courses taken

```{r}
quant_surv_df %>%
  dplyr::select(., Course, Took_psy, Took_oth) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(., Took_total = Took_psy + Took_oth) %>%
  dplyr::filter(., Took_total > 0) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(., desc(Took_total)) %>%
  knitr::kable(., format = 'html')
```

## Top courses desired

```{r}
quant_surv_df %>%
  dplyr::select(., Course, Offer_reg, Offer_summ) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(., Offer_total = Offer_reg + Offer_summ) %>%
  dplyr::filter(., Offer_total > 0) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(., desc(Offer_total)) %>%
  knitr::kable(., format = 'html')
```
